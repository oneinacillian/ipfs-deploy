UDP Buffer Sizes

It is recommended to increase the maximum buffer size by running:

sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=7500000
sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=7500000
This command would increase the maximum send and the receive buffer size to roughly 7.5 MB. Note that these settings are not persisted across reboots.
